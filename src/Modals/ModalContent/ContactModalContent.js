      <p>
        Right now I'm open to full-time frontend developer positions in Glasgow
        or remote. Let me know if you'd like me to send you over a full copy of
        my CV (it has just a few extra details).
      </p>
      <p>
        Also open to other opportunities, requests, and questions - so please
        don't hesitate to get in touch.
      </p>
